## ✨ About the project

This project showcases my ability to build an interactive browser-based game using **vanilla JavaScript**, **responsive CSS Grid**, and clean HTML structure.  
It’s part of my journey learning **frontend web development** and putting into practice modern coding patterns and UX-focused design.

**Features:**
- ✅ Fully functional 2-player Tic Tac Toe
- ✅ Clean, modern UI with responsive design
- ✅ Game automatically detects and announces a winner
- ✅ Uses modular JavaScript (**IIFE** pattern) to keep code organized
- ✅ Smooth hover effects and subtle shadows for an engaging look
- ✅ Deployed online via **GitHub Pages** for instant demo

## 🧠 What I learned

Through building this project, I deepened my understanding of:

**JavaScript**
- Designing modular applications using **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)**
- DOM manipulation: event listeners, dynamic updates, and using `querySelectorAll`
- Implementing game logic with `Array.prototype.some()` and `every()`
- Keeping code clean by separating logic from rendering

**CSS & HTML**
- Building responsive layouts with **CSS Grid** (`repeat`, `minmax`)
- Styling using **CSS variables** for easier theming
- Using `clamp()` for adaptive typography
- Creating a modern, polished UI with hover effects and shadows

**Workflow**
- Writing structured, meaningful commit messages
- Hosting a static site on **GitHub Pages**
- Structuring code to be maintainable and scalable
